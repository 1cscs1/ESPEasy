Events
------

The GPS plugin may send several events:

* GPS#GotFix
* GPS#LostFix


Preferred Settings
------------------

A GPS receiver is rather 'chatty', so it is strongly advised to use hardware serial ports.

The ESP8266 only has 2 HW serial ports, but only Serial0 uses a HW RX pin.
The TX channel from the ESP to the GPS is not needed for this plugin.

The used baudrate is 9600 bps.

PPS pin
-------

Some GPS receivers have a PPS pin.
This can be used to get a very accurate time reference.
According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-per-second_signal>`_ this signal could be considered a "stratum-1 time source".

The signal on the PPS pin is a high pulse of +/- 100 msec and the rising edge signals the start of a second.
The time reported after this pulse describes the past rising edge of the PPS pulse.

N.B. Currently the PPS feature is not thoroughly tested yet, so consider it experimental.


Future plans
------------

The following new features may be added later:

* Selectable baud rate
* New event: GPS#Travelled  to signal when a preset distance was moved since previous event.
* New event: GPS#Geofence   to signal when within set distance from a set target. (e.g. home)
* Change of output units (km, miles, etc)
* Use some threshold on used satellites and HDOP values.
